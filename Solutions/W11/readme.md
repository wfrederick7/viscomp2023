# VSCode
We recommend using VSCode as an IDE for completing the exercises.
For security, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts, meaning they may only use the HTTP/HTTPS URL scheme. This does not work for local files. Hence, we suggest to use VSCode as an IDE and install the vscode_preview_server extension. When right-clicking on the index.html file, you will find the option for previewing the scene in the either in the browser or on a panel in VSCode directly.
