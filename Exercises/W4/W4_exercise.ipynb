Hint: the high pass content of an image can be extracted by subtracting the low pass filtered image from the original image. Hence, you can get a high pass filter kernel from a low pass one by subtracting the low pass filter kernel from a unit impulse filter. A unit impulse filter is a filter full of 0s with a single 1 in the middle, that once convolved with an image returns the same image.\n",
